# PRB Math Blended App - Fixed Version

A Blended application that implements PRB Math functions using both Solidity and Rust on the Fluent network. This repository has been updated to fix contract errors and implement the correct structure based on the blended-template repository.

## Network Compatibility Status

**Important Note**: 
- The application is currently working properly on **Ethereum Sepolia** testnet.
- The application is **NOT working** on the Fluent network due to errors in the WebAssembly file when deploying the Rust contract on Fluent.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Rust Contract**: Updated the lib.rs file to correctly use the proper interfaces and types from the fluentbase-sdk.
2. **Cargo.toml**: Updated the Cargo.toml with the correct dependencies and features.
3. **Solidity Contract**: Created a new FluentSdkRustTypesTest.sol contract that interfaces properly with the Rust contract.
4. **JavaScript Integration**: Created two JavaScript files for testing: solidity.js (to test the Solidity contract calling Rust) and rust.js (to directly call the Rust contract).

## Deployment Instructions

For detailed deployment instructions, see [deployment-instructions.md](./deployment-instructions.md).

### Quick Start

1. Deploy the Rust contract
   ```bash
   cd rust
   gblend build rust -r
   gblend deploy --private-key $devTestnetPrivateKey --dev lib.wasm --gas-limit 3000000
   ```

2. Deploy the Solidity contract with the Rust contract address
   ```bash
   cd ../solidity
   forge create FluentSdkRustTypesTest.sol:FluentSdkRustTypesTest \
   --constructor-args-path constructor-args.txt \
   --private-key $devTestnetPrivateKey \
   --rpc-url https://rpc.dev.gblend.xyz/ \
   --broadcast
   ```

3. Test the integration with JavaScript
   ```bash
   npm install
   node solidity.js
   node rust.js
   ```

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, update these addresses in the JavaScript files:

- Rust Contract: `0x04160C19738bB6429c0554fBdC11A96079D7297D` (placeholder)
- Solidity Contract: `0xD96a275ca2e9Ef5B10bF9fDb106718b670Afc8B2` (placeholder)

## Notes

This implementation follows the structure and practices recommended in the [blended-template](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/blended-template) repository. The original PRB Math functionality has been replaced with more basic type demonstration to focus on the core Rust-Solidity integration.

## Overview

This project implements mathematical functions that are commonly used in Solidity smart contracts but executes the core logic in Rust for better performance and security. The implementation includes:

- Square root (sqrt)
- Exponential function (exp)
- Natural logarithm (ln)
- Base-10 logarithm (log10)
- Base-2 logarithm (log2)

The application leverages the Fluent network's "Blended" architecture, which allows smart contracts to combine EVM and WebAssembly execution environments seamlessly. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Performance**: Rust execution is faster and more efficient than Solidity
2. **Security**: Rust's strong type system helps prevent common programming errors
3. **Flexibility**: Developers can still use familiar Solidity interfaces
4. **Interoperability**: The contract can interact with other EVM-compatible contracts

## Smart Contracts

### Rust Contract

The Rust contract uses the Fluentbase SDK to implement mathematical functions with fixed-point arithmetic (18 decimal places of precision):

1. **sqrt(x)**: Calculates the square root of a number using Newton's method.
2. **exp(x)**: Calculates e^x using a Taylor series approximation.
3. **ln(x)**: Calculates the natural logarithm using mathematical approximations.
4. **log10(x)**: Calculates the base-10 logarithm using the relation log10(x) = ln(x) / ln(10).
5. **log2(x)**: Calculates the base-2 logarithm using the relation log2(x) = ln(x) / ln(2).

### Solidity Contract

The Solidity contract (`prbMathBlended.sol`) acts as a facade that forwards calls to the Rust implementation. It provides a familiar Solidity interface for developers while leveraging the performance benefits of Rust. The contract includes:

- Function wrappers for all math operations
- Input validation and error handling
- Fixed-point arithmetic utilities
- Proper documentation with NatSpec comments

## Frontend

The React-based frontend provides a modern user interface to interact with the math functions:

- Connect your wallet to the Fluent testnet
- Input values for each function and calculate results in real-time
- Visualize functions with interactive charts
- View calculation history
- Copy results to clipboard

The frontend is built with React and Vite, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or similar terminal (for Windows users)
- [Fluent CLI](https://docs.fluent.xyz/tools/cli) (for deployment)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or compatible Web3 wallet

## Setup and Building

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prb-math-blended.git
cd prb-math-blended
```

### 2. Install Rust wasm32 target

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 3. Build the project

On Windows:
```bash
./build.bat
```

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly
- Prepare the Solidity contract
- Copy all files to a `deployment` folder

## Running the Frontend Locally

To run the React frontend locally for development:

```bash
cd prb-math-react-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, typically at http://localhost:5173/

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy the Rust WebAssembly contract

```bash
fluent contract deploy ./deployment/prb_math_wasm.wasm
```

Note the deployed contract address.

### 2. Deploy the Solidity contract

```bash
fluent solidity deploy ./deployment/prbMathBlended.sol --constructor-args <rust_contract_address>
```

Replace `<rust_contract_address>` with the address from step 1.

### 3. Update the frontend configuration

Edit `frontend/js/app.js` and update the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` constant with your deployed Solidity contract address:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourDeployedContractAddress";
```

Also verify and update the Fluent network configuration if needed:

```javascript
const FLUENT_NETWORK = {
    name: 'Fluent Testnet',
    chainId: 424242,  // Replace with actual Fluent chain ID
    rpcUrl: 'https://testnet.fluent.xyz',  // Replace with actual RPC URL
    blockExplorer: 'https://explorer.testnet.fluent.xyz'  // Replace with actual explorer URL
};
```

### 4. Serve the frontend

You can use any web server to host the frontend files. For local testing:

```bash
npx serve ./deployment/frontend
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the frontend in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
2. Connect your wallet to the Fluent testnet
3. Enter values in the input fields
4. Click "Calculate" to see the results
5. Use the graph visualization to understand the function behavior
6. View calculation history for past operations

## Troubleshooting and Fixes

If you encounter issues running the project, here are some common fixes:

### 1. Fluentbase SDK Compatibility Issues

The Fluentbase SDK is actively being developed, and API changes may occur. If you see errors related to the SDK, try these solutions:

- Update the Cargo.toml file to pin to a specific commit that works with the code:
  ```toml
  fluentbase-sdk = {git = "https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase", rev = "e0dfac5", default-features = false}
  ```

- Use `simple_entrypoint!()` instead of `basic_entrypoint!()` to avoid issues with the import linker.

- If experiencing math function errors, consider adding `libm` as a dependency:
  ```toml
  libm = "0.2.8"
  ```

### 2. Build Script Issues

The build scripts may fail when creating directories or copying files. Updated scripts with error handling and proper directory checking are included in the latest version.

### 3. Rust Implementation Structure

For best compatibility, use the following structure for the contract:

```rust
#[derive(Contract)]
struct PRBMATH<SDK> {
    sdk: SDK,
}

impl<SDK: SharedAPI> PRBMATH<SDK> {
    // Functions go here with #[fluentbase_sdk::derive::function_id("...")] 
    // instead of trait implementation with #[function_id("...")]
}
```

### 4. Fixed-Point Math Implementation

The PRB Math functions use fixed-point arithmetic with 18 decimal places. Be sure to handle type conversions correctly, especially when working with `I256::from_raw()` where the input should be cast to `i128` for proper handling.

### 5. Frontend Integration

If you encounter issues with the React frontend:

- Make sure to have Node.js 16+ installed
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`
- Update the contract address in App.jsx after deployment
- Ensure MetaMask or another Web3 wallet is installed in the browser
